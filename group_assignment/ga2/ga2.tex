\section{Solution}
\subsection{The algorithm definition}
Run Karger's extended algorithm several times to find and save all Mincuts. Calculate probability to miss one or more Mincuts.

\subsection{Pseudo code}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State $solutions \gets \emptyset$
\State $minCut \gets \infty$
\For{$1$ to $N$}
    \State ($cut$,A,B) $\gets \text{Karger\textquotesingle s extended algorithm(G)}$
    \If{$cut < minCut$}
        \State $solutions \gets \emptyset$
        \State $minCut \gets cut$
    \If{$cut = minCut$}
        \If{(A,B) not in $solutions$}
            \State $solutions \gets solutions \cup \text{(A,B)}$

\subsection{Algorithm analysis}

\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{\textbf{Lemma 1:} The probability of Karger's algorithm finds a Mincut in a graph $G = (V,E)$ is $ \ge \frac{2}{n(n-1)} > \frac{1}{n^2} $ which is $\Omega (\frac{1}{n^2})$ where $|V|= n$. \newline

\textit{Proof:} Proven in class.
}}

\vspace{2mm}\noindent\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{\textbf{Lemma 2:} The following inequality holds for $x \ge 1: (1-\frac{1}{x})^x \le \frac{1}{e}$. \newline

\textit{Proof:} Proven in class.
}}

\vspace{2mm}\noindent\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{\textbf{Lemma 3:} Karger's algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time. Karger's extended algorithm adds and retrieves from a map in constant time so it still has a running time of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. \newline

\textit{Proof:} Proven in class
}}

\vspace{2mm}\noindent\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{\textbf{Lemma 4:} The probability that Karger's algorithm does not find a Mincut is $< 1 - \frac{1}{n^2}$ \newline

\textit{Proof:} From lemma 1 we get the probability that Karger's algorithm finds a Mincut is $> \frac{1}{n^2}$ hence we can conclude that the probability to not find a Mincut is $< 1 - \frac{1}{n^2}$.
}}

\vspace{2mm}\noindent\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{\textbf{Lemma 5:} The maximum amount of Mincuts in $V$ is $n^2$. \newline

\textit{Proof}: From lemma 1 we have the probability to find a Mincut is $> \frac{1}{n^2}$. Since the event of finding a Mincut is disjoint from finding another Mincut, we are able to realize that the number of Mincuts in a graph are less than $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{n^2}} = n^2$.
}}

\vspace{2mm}\noindent\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{\textbf{Lemma 6:} If running the algorithm $3 n^2 \log n$ times, the probability to find all Mincuts is $> p = \frac{2}{3}$. \newline

\textit{Proof}: By running Karger's extended algorithm $3n^2 \log n$ times we get the following: 

\[Pr[\text{missing some MinCut}] < \Big(1 - \frac{1}{n^2}\Big)^{2n^2 \log n} = \bigg(\Big(1 - \frac{1}{n^2}\Big)^{n^2}\bigg)^{3 \log n}\]

the inequality $(1-\frac{1}{x^2})^2 \le \frac{1}{e}$ holds for $x \ge 1 $. Using this knowledge we get the following:

\[Pr[\text{missing some MinCut}] < \bigg(\Big(1 - \frac{1}{n^2}\Big)^{n^2}\bigg)^{3 \log n} \le \Big(\frac{1}{e}\Big)^{3\log n}\]

Which brings us to

\[Pr[\text{missing some MinCut}] < \frac{1}{e^{3 \log n}} = \frac{1}{e^{\log n^3}} = \frac{1}{n^3}\]

Now because we know from lemma 5 that the event of finding a Mincut is disjoint from finding another and that the total number of Mincuts is less than $n^2$ we can calculate the probability that at least one of the Mincuts remain unfound.

\[Pr[\text{missing at least 1 Mincut}] < n^2 \frac{1}{n^3} = \frac{1}{n}\]

We know from the definition of Mincut that  $n > 2$ which leads to

\[Pr[\text{missing at least 1 Mincut}]\frac{1}{3}\]

With this it is trivial to find that 

\[Pr[\text{find all Mincuts}] = 1 - Pr[\text{missing at least 1 Mincut}] > \frac{2}{3} = p > 0\]
}}

\vspace{2mm}\noindent\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{\textbf{Lemma 7:} The algorithm runs in polynomial time. \newline

\textit{Proof}: Time complexity to run Karger's extended algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and in our solution we run Karger's algorithm $3 n^2 \log n$ times, this yields:

\[\mathcal{O}(n^2 \times 3 n^2 \log n) = \mathcal{O}(n^4 \log n) \]
